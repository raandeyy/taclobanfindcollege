            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p> &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp The Bachelor of Science in Geological Engineering program is designed to prepare 
                students for careers as professional geologists, researchers and/or for admission to graduate 
                school who are expected to be engaged in relevant issues in the society and industry. The 
                program is structured to provide an optimal curriculum that affords graduates with firm 
                foundations on the concepts and theories in the geological sciences through transformative 
                learning strategies. Graduates of this program are in academic, industrial, and government 
                sectors. Job functions include research, teaching, corporate training, higher education 
                administration, outreach, public service, and educational policy. The program consists of 
                Geological Engineering courses divided into two categories of core courses, required geological 
                engineering courses, Electives and non-Geology courses. The program will adopt outcome-based 
                education (OBE) framework with flipped classroom and other blended learning pedagogies.</p>

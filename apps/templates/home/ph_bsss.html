            <h3>Program Overview</h3>

The fitness and sports coaching major is part of a standalone degree, but it enhances and complements the coaching licensure and/or certification accredited by relevant international and national governing sports bodies, as well as fitness-related certifications by reputable organizations in the field. This knowledge and skills base allows graduates to address the relevant needs of employers and pursue further specialization studies. </p>

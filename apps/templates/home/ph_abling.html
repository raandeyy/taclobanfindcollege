            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p> &nbsp  &nbsp The BA in Linguistics program provides students with training in the fundamentals of contemporary linguistic theories and methodologies for linguistic analysis, which will enable them to study languages scientifically for research, translation work, teaching, and other various purposes.

                The undergraduate program in linguistics also encourages students to explore possible interdisciplinary connections between linguistics and other fields, including disciplines under the fields of social sciences, science, humanities, and education.
                
                Students can choose from among three plans of study where, along with developing their specialization in linguistics, they can also specialize in an East Asian language, a foreign Southeast Asian language, or select cognate courses in a related discipline.</p>

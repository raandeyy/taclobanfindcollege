            <h3>Program Overview</h3>
            <p> &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp The Bachelor of Fine Arts Major (BFA) in Sculpture  is a program in the Philippines that is concerned with expressing interests and ideas in three-dimensional (3-D) art.
                As a branch of Fine Arts, it shares a lot of similar courses with BFA Major in Painting; however, contrary to the latter that focuses on drawings and illustrations, Sculpture is more concerned with sculpting techniques such as engraving, cold casting, and manipulative modeling as well as the various materials that can be used for sculpture such as wood, metal, clay, and food.</a>
